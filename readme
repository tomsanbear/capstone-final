Final compilation of code for the EKG fingerprint system. 

Required libraries for running this code is the GoIO SDK and its dependencies, libusb, and build-essentials

To compile, make clean, then make all. Provided you are running on standard g++, no issues should arise!

The main components are as follows:
-EKG Data Logger [done]
-EKG Filtering System [done]
-Flush data to file [done]
-Autocorrelation component [done]
-LDA algorithm [done]
-Final compilation algorithm [done]
-Scoring method [done]
-UI [done]

This software could not have been completed without the AlgLib, DSPFilters, GoIO libraries.
